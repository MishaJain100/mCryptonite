<b>Introduction: </b>
This writeup details the solution to Day 2 of the Advent of Cyber 2023 challenge titled 'Data Science and Python'. McHoneyBell, leader of the B Team, is assigned the task of understanding AntarctiCrafts' South Pole site network using data science techniques. The challenge involves using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze network traffic data.<br><br>

<b>Author:</b> Misha Jain<br><br>

<b>Date:</b> December 2, 2023<br><br>

<b>Tools Used:</b><br>
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib<br><br>

<b>Challenge Description:</b><br>
Day 2 introduces the B Team to data science concepts and Python programming. The focus is on understanding AntarctiCrafts' network through the analysis of network traffic data. The tasks include a crash course in Python, introduction to Pandas for data manipulation, and using Matplotlib for data visualization.<br><br>

<b>Exploitation:</b><br>
1. Click on the "Start Machine" button to access the Jupyter Notebooks. The machine is preconfigured with the necessary tools for Python programming and data analysis.<br><br>

2. Access the "Workbook.ipynb" notebook in the "4_Capstone" directory. Analyze the provided dataset "network_traffic.csv" using Pandas and Matplotlib. Answer the questions based on the analysis.<br><br>Answers to Capstone Questions:
- How many packets were captured (looking at the PacketNumber)?: 100
- What IP address sent the most amount of traffic during the packet capture?: 10.10.1.4
- What was the most frequent protocol?: ICMP<br>
