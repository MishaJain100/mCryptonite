<b>Challenge Description:</b><br>
Of late, whispers doth persist behind mine back. Yesterday, under the studio tower, a peculiar contraption was found by me. I am most intrigued to discover the content of their discourse.

<br>

<b>Exploitation:</b><br>
Received two files, a .wav file named 486_375MHz-1MSps-1MHz.wav and a flash_dump.exe file, which was DOS executable. I figured the peculiar name of the file would hold a clue, but was unable to figure out what it was. I explored tools like Deepsound, again without luck. Tried binwalk as well, got nowhere unfortunately.
