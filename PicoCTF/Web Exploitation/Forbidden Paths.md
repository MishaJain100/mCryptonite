<b>Challenge Description:</b><br>
Forbidden Paths is a web exploitation challenge that requires participants to identify hidden directories or paths within a web application. By exploring and accessing these forbidden paths, the flag can be obtained.

<b>Exploitation:</b><br>
1. Visit the provided URL for the Forbidden Paths challenge and explore the functionality of the web application.<br>

![](<Pictures/Forbidden Paths - Exploring_Domain.png>)

</p><br>

2. We know that the files are present in the "/usr/share/nginx/html/" directory, and the flag.txt file is present in the root directory. So, to reach the root directory, and display the flag.txt file, we can use the following input:

<p align = 'center'>../../../../flag.txt</p><br>

<p align = 'center'>

![](<Pictures/Forbidden Paths - Flag.png>)

</p><br>

<b>Conclusion:</b><br>
The Forbidden Paths challenge provides practical experience in finding and accessing hidden paths within a web application. It emphasizes the significance of proper access controls and the potential security risks associated with exposed directories.
