<b>Challenge Description:</b><br>
The "Buffer Overflow 0" challenge in PicoCTF involves binary exploitation. Participants must analyze the given binary executable to identify and exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability to retrieve the flag.

<b>Exploitation:</b><br>
On opening the source code, we see that on line 40, the gets() function is called, and reads buf1 onto the stack. This function writes the userâ€™s input to the stack without regard to its allocated length. The user can simply overflow this length, and the program will pass their input into the vuln() function to trigger a segmentation fault.
